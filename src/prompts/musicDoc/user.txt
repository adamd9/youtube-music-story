Topic: {{TOPIC}}

Narrative and style goals:
- Write like a professional music journalist: vivid, precise, and informative.
- If provided, subtly adopt this persona and tone: {{STYLE}}.
- Ensure the entire outline flows strictly in chronological order.

Structural goals:
- Provide a short, human-friendly playlist title and place it in the `title` field.
- Provide a brief, compelling summary that reads like the lead-in to a great audio documentary.
- Pick exactly 5 songs that best represent the topic's narrative arc.
- Build a single interleaved `timeline` array mixing narration and songs, strictly alternating as a documentary would.
- The FIRST timeline item MUST be a narration segment that:
  - Introduces that this is a short audio documentary.
  - Names the artist/band and clearly states the time period or scope being covered.
  - Sets expectations for what the listener will learn or hear.
- BEFORE EACH SONG, include a narration segment that:
  - Introduces the song (title and year) and that it is about to play.
  - Provides concise historical context: what was happening with the band/scene/production at that moment and why the track matters.
  - Delves into the production and recording process of the song, along with any interesting production details or anecdotes.

Timing preference (strictly follow):
- The user wants each narration segment to be approximately {{NARRATION_TARGET_SECS}} seconds of spoken content.
- Keep narration concise but sufficiently detailed; adjust sentence count to match the target time.
- Aim within ±10% of the target per segment; split or tighten phrasing as needed while preserving clarity and chronology.

Catalog rules:
- If a catalog is provided, select songs ONLY from it.
- For each song, include accurate `title` and `artist`. Optionally include a concise `youtube_hint` that could help find the correct video (e.g., year, version, or disambiguation notes).
